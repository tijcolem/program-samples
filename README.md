Various Example Programs (python, php, perl, C++)

AJAX: Example php pages that produce xml to support menu selections for AJAX driven websites.

DataDistrubution: Example python programs to distribute local data sets to third parties. 

DataEnconding:   Example python programs that encode/convert data sets into desired output. In this case, these programs encode data to binary BUFR and NetCDF, which are commonly used formats in the meteorological and science communities.

DataIngestion:  Example python and perl programs for ingesting data from outside sources and parsing into desired formats. 

GridExtraction:  Example python programs that extract data from NetCDF data files and call graphics code to produce raster images that feed decision support tools. 

MatlabPlotCalipso: Example python programs that reads HDF data files and uses matlabplot libraries to produce desired images.  In this case it uses CALIPSO satellite data. More info can be found here: http://hdfeos.org/zoo/index_openLaRC_Examples.php

NclGraphics:  Example ncl and python programs that produce graphics to support decision support tools. In these examples, programs read in Scanning radar and Model output in NetCDF format and produce raster images to overlay onto GIS web mapping applications (Google Maps).

ShefDistro: Example python programs that converts native data into SHEF encoded data.

WebAppFrostForecastModels:  Web application decision support tool to alert users of potential frost. It uses js flot libraries to dynamically plot various model output data for temperature, relative humidity for specific locations in the country.

WebAppGoogleMapScanRadar: Web application that uses Google Maps to overlay scanning radar raster images in real-time. It features two maps adjacent to each-other to allow side-by-side comparison of nearby scanning radars.

XMLGen: Example python programs that produce xml content for use with web-applications. 

FileDirectory:  C++ Application that verifies meteorological data content on disk and transfers data into archival repository.
